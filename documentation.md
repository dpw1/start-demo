## Editing the front-end code

The code that is injected in the front end can be located under the folder "public". The files are:

- inject_js.js
- inject_css.css

All HTML is being injected via Javascript.

## Developing the project

## Editing the front-end CSS

This project uses .SCSS. The compiled SCSS generates the inject_css.css
